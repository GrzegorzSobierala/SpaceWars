- **Story Driven Action in the Bubbleverse**  
  Embark on an epic narrative set in a universe of interconnected “bubbles” of space beyond their shimmering boundaries lies nothingness. Uncover the secrets that bind these worlds together and save civilization from collapse!

  - **Physics Based Dynamic Combat**  
  Engage in true 2D physics driven battles where momentum is conserved. Fire up any of your four thrusters to maneuver in all directions, execute rapid dashes, or fling a grappling hook to swing around obstacles and dodge incoming fire with finesse.

- **Modular Spacecraft**  
  Before each mission, choose the best loadout for your ship. Customize with precise rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, or reinforced armor for frontal assaults.

- **Smart Enemy AI & Alert System**  
  Hostile ships have a visible field of view. If they spot you or any ally already in combat they’ll converge on your position. Stay undetected or hit them fast before backup arrives!

- **Demo Mission**  
  Your primary objective is to destroy the enemy’s Main Station. Sabotage a Supply Station to weaken defenses, intercept a critical Cargo Ship to sever supply lines, or launch a full‑frontal assault—choose your strategy.
